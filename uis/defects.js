/**
 * Safari is a defect. It should not exist, it is an abomination. I don't even know where to start
 * No canvas filter support
 * No pattern fill nearest neighbour support (blurry clouds before webgl2 rewrite)
 * Almost all css metrics are rounded to integers, completely butchering pretty much any scaled-up css art
 * as well as canvas metrics with methods like .measureText()
 * Page zoom does not properly update devicePixelRatio,
 * making it completely impossible to reliably measure a physical pixel
 * Mediocre pointerlock and fullscreen support
 * Not adequately performant in many common tasks
 * Only very recently supports import maps, OffscreenCanvas, etc...
 * Missing important sandbox and allow attributes on iframes
