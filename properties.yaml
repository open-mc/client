  # default -> normal terrain generation

  # fill -> Completely underground-only world, no grass trees or oceans
  # void -> all air, no blocks whatsoever

  # You can force a dimension to generate like another with a slash
  # E.g you could set overworld: nether/perlin, and netherrack caves will generate in the overworld

  # superflat -> 1 layer of grass, 3 layers of dirt, stone below that. No features whatsoever
